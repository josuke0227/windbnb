<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](https://github.com/josuke0227/windbnb/blob/main/screen-shot1.png)

It was my first full-comittal project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (used React) so I've learned a lot of things.
What I felt the most challenging about this project was to handle the case when there is no matching data for search query,
because the timing when I can filter the data is only when the search button was pushed.
I was also amazed by how powerful styled component is!

### Built With

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)

## Features
You can delete search factors by clicking cancel icons.

You can expand nav bar by clicking on search panel, close it by:
- Clicking an empty space of nav area.
- Wheel down
- Clicking on modal area.
